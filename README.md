Working
---
- Resolve all subdomains to IP addresses. Save IPs to list1.txt
- Go to http://shodan.io and search Ssl.cert.subject.CN:"domain.com"
- Save the IPs you get from http://shodan.io in list2.txt
- Remove all the list1.txt IPs from list2.txt
- Probe all IPs from list2.txt.
- That's it. You now have a list of target's IPs that don't have a subdomain hosted on them.
